# Here are various demos/functions that I have created over time.

The majority of these are to understand and solve problems that I encounter for code challenges.
Some are created as demonstrations for blogposts that I write - if this is the case, related blogposts will be outlined under the explanation.

_Note: items described as a 'demo' have been created as React components for visualization purposes._

## Functionalities // How do ______ work in ______ framework/language?

### Keys Demo
[Related Blogpost](https://jayewe.com/under-the-hood-of-react-why-you-shouldnt-use-index-as-keys/)  

Meant to explain how keys work in React, as well as how they relate to array indexes and DOM updating. 


## Algorithms

### Reverse Linked List Demo

Meant to further my understanding of how to work with linked lists.
Used to answer linked list code challenge.

### Reverse String In Place Demo

Used to solve code challenge to reverse a string in place.

### Stock-Price Algo

Used to better understand/solve code challenge, where an array is provided, and you are asked to create 
an algorithm to output the maximum profit (buying_price-selling_price) able to be achieved where:

index(buying_price) < index(selling_price)
